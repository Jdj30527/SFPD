Website hosted on AWS.

Summary:


Hello, my name is John Jefferies. I am a first year computer science major at Virginia Tech, also with a minor in theatre. I would like to introduce my first ever experience with web design! When I received this project from Capital One I was extremely nervous to try something new and to have someone judge it, but over the course of me making this website, I realized that I can learn from this. I learned the basics of HTML and CSS as well as using some JavaScript to create the visuals on the page. I created the theme of the page myself with CSS. To retrieve the data from the file given to me, I used the MatLab software I used in my engineering courses to extract and compare data types. I tried to use JavaScript to complete this, but I could not figure out how to complete the process that I did with MatLab. I used resources at my school to help me with the MatLab software.
