# SFPD Statistics
Website design for CapOne application. Uses HTML, CSS, JS, and MatLab.
Website hosted on AWS.

Summary:


Hello, my name is John Jefferies. I am a first year computer science major at Virginia Tech, also with a minor in theatre. I would like to introduce my first ever experience with web design! When I received this project from Capital One I was extremely nervous to try something new and to have someone judge it, but over the course of me making this website, I realized that I can learn from this. I learned the basics of HTML and CSS as well as using some JavaScript to create the visuals on the page. I created the theme of the page myself with CSS. To retrieve the data from the file given to me, I used the MatLab software I used in my engineering courses to extract and compare data types. I tried to use JavaScript to complete this, but I could not figure out how to complete the process that I did with MatLab. I used resources at my school to help me with the MatLab software.

Visuals:

  Call Types - I decided to look at the different call types that the department recieved. In my own life, I had thought about what types of calls police departments recieve normally so I decided to see what types San Francisco recieved and how many of each. I decided a bar graph would be the best visual for displaying this information.

  Dispatch Uniit Types - This visual looked at the different types of dispatches that were used over the period of time. I was interested to see how many types of transportation were used. I thought that it would tell me about how the first responder group worked (like what types of transportation is normally used).

  Priority Change - This visual lloked at the initial priority and the final priority of each call. I wondered if there were many instances where the priority increased, to see if situations usually got worse over time. The data showed that it stayed the same for most calls.
  
Which Dispatch:

This part of the project I was the most confused on. I did not fully understand what the problem was asking me to complete. I thought that I was supposed to have a submission field for user input of an address, but I had no idea on how to implement that idea. I also was not sure if I needed locations for the dispatches to compare the user input to to find the proper dispatch. I decided that I would not finish this deliverable in time for submission.


Dispatch Times:

I did not even know how to extrapolate the data in the way that I wanted to complete this aspect of the project. I knew that I needed to look at the times between the initial call and when the dispatch arrived on the scene; however, I had no idea how to do that with MatLab. I was able to get help on how to use the Excel data and extract what I needed; however, the computer I was using at the time froze when I tried to run the program with the whole Excel file. This meant that I had to split the program in to ten parts of one thousand. I was able to find the maximum time for each one thousand and used that to create the table and map on the web page.

Heat Maps:

I also added two heat maps, one for all calls and one for only alarm calls. The alarm call map shows the areas that moght be more dangerous given the amount of break-ins.
